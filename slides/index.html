	<h2>WordPress themes are everywhere.</h2> 
	<p>If you do a Google search for "WordPress Theme" you will find over 809,000,000 results! Keep in mind though that not all themes are created equal.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
	<h2>Reputation Matters</h2>
<p>If you are going to download a WordPress theme, make sure it is from a reputable place. Sometimes websites advertising free WordPress themes are really distributing themes with malicious code, themes that have not been tested, or are not well supported.</p> 
<p>If you are searching for a free WordPress theme, it is wise to start with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">WordPress Theme Directory</a>. All of these themes have been reviewed by a team of WordPress developers and tested against the latest coding standards.</p>
</section>


	<section class="slide">
		<h2>Practice uploading a theme</h2>
		<p>Most premium themes will require that you download the theme from your account with them and upload the .zip file to your website.  We can practice by downloading a theme from WordPress.org and manually uploading it.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Go to <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes">http://wordpress.org/themes</a></li>
			<li>Find a theme you'd like to practice with</li>
			<li>Download the theme and upload it to your site</li>

		<ol>
			<li>Commercial WordPress Theme Shops</li>

		<h2>Which of the following is NOT a criterion when choosing a theme?</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Browser compatibility</li>
			<li>WordPress and plugins compatibility</li>
			<li>Responsiveness</li>
			<li>Freebies received from a Premium theme</li>
			<li class="next">4</li>

	<section class="slide">
		<h2>What to consider when choosing a theme?</h2>

<p>It is important to have a solid idea of the purpose, and audience, for your site.</p>
<ul><li>Will your site function primarily as a personal blog for friends and family to read?</li> 
	<li>Does your site focus on sharing articles and content, like a magazine or newspaper would?</li> 
	<li>Are you looking to build a site for your business that showcases information about your staff, services, or products?</li>
	</ul>
	</section> 

	<section class="slide">
		<h2>Content Considerations</h2>
		<ul><li>Will photography be a main focus, if so you may want to choose a theme that has large featured image areas.</li>
		<li>Will your site just focus on written content, if so choose one with striking typography and a smaller emphasis on images.</li>
	</ul>
<p><strong>One important note:</strong> You should select a theme based on how it displays your content and not for specific features. You can always add specific features such as restaurant menus, calendars, contact forms, and photo galleries via plugins.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
	<h2>How to evaluate a theme?</h2>
<p>Once you have your list of theme requirements, you will want to narrow down the possible themes. If you are reviewing themes in the Theme Directory, you can use feature filter option and select the features that are important to you.</p>

<p>Take a look at what can be customized in each theme. Many themes come with additional color palettes, font choices and custom widget areas. These are all things that can be adjusted using the WordPress Customizer.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
	<h2>Some of the important criteria when evaluating a theme.</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Mobile devices are commonly used nowadays for web surfing. Your theme should be responsive across a wide range of devices in order to support various screen sizes.</li>
			<li><strong>Browser Compatibility</strong>: Visitors to your site could be using different kinds of browsers. Make sure your theme is able to support most of the major browser platforms on computers and mobile devices.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<h2>Criteria continued</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Ratings:</strong> A theme with low ratings could mean that the theme has poor design, a lot of bugs or even poor support given by the theme designer. Make sure you read the ratings, and reviews, when selecting a theme.</li>
			<li><strong>Budget and Support:</strong> Both of these criteria can be interrelated. Premium themes usually cost around $50 to $100 depending on the quality but that also means users can expect better and faster support from the theme designer. Free themes normally get support on the WordPress.org support forum.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
	<h2>Criteria continued</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Compatibility with WordPress and Plugins:</strong> This is one of the most important criteria when choosing a theme, especially if you're building a site with extensive usage of plugins.</li></ul>
